# IRIS GAN 
## Overview
This is a proof of concept of GANs and their working. I have implement a GAN on the basic IRIS dataset for class 0 and hence generated fake data for that class.

## Features 
- Created a Discriminator (classifier) and a Generator and trained them on iris data.
- Visualized the fabricated data against the real data 

## Libraries 
- torch 
- matplotlib

## Dataset
Data used is of iris data which is available in sklearn.datasets
